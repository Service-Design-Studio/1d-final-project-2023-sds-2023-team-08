### **About the project**
- This project aims to enhance the existing DBS digiBank mobile application by introducing a streamlined and user-friendly process for resolving fund transfer disputes (FTDs). <br>
- Our goal is to provide an efficient and reliable online service that simplifies the dispute resolution procedure, benefiting both users and DBS Bank.

### **Technology Stack**
- Frontend: The application's frontend is built using the [React.js](https://react.dev/) framework, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- Backend: The backend is developed using [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), providing a robust and scalable foundation for data processing and business logic.
- Deployment: The application is deployed on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), ensuring reliable and secure access.

### **Testing overview**
- Cucumber with Selenium for System testing
- Rspec for backend unit testing 
- Postman for API integration testing

### **Features**
There are 4 primary features that has been implemented into our app:
1. Recent Transcation Page
2. DIgitalising Fund Transfer Dispute (From raising to resolving)
