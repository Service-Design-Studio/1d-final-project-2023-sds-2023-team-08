### **About the project**
- This project aims to enhance the existing DBS digiBank mobile application by introducing a streamlined and user-friendly process for resolving fund transfer disputes (FTDs). <br>
- Our goal is to provide an efficient and reliable online service that simplifies the dispute resolution procedure, benefiting both users and DBS Bank.

### **Technology Stack**
- Frontend: The application's frontend is built using the [React.js](https://react.dev/) framework, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user interface.

- Deployment: The application is deployed on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), ensuring reliable and secure access.

### **Testing overview**
