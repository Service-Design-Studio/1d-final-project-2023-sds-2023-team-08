# README

This README documents whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

This README also explains the project usage.

### Introduction
This is the Transaction and Disputes microservice which is linked to the main posgresql database of the banking app. Built using Ruby On Rails.

### Prerequisites
* Ensure you have ruby installed. This project uses ruby version 3.2.2 . run `ruby -v` in your terminal to check
* Ensure you have the package manager RubyGems installed by running `gem -v`
* Install Bundler, the gem manager, by running `gem install bundler`
* Ensure you have posgresql installed locally and set up a database for this project with username and password
  

### Installation Guide
* Clone this repository.
* Ensure you are in /backend_cloudSQL_latest folder
* run `bundle install` to install all dependencies

### Set up and run app locally
* connect to local database by going under default section and modifying the username and password field respectively in database.yml file
* run the following :
* `rails db:create    # Creates the database`
* `rails db:migrate   # Runs database migrations`
* `rails db:seed      # Seeds the database with initial data (if applicable)` 
* to run the app locally, run `rails server` and open localhost

### Prerequisite: Deployment to GCloud
* set up a project in gcloud console
* ensure Google Cloud SDK is installed
* refer to sections:
* Before You Begin
* Set the Project Default
* set up a CloudSQL for POSGRESQL instance 
* store secret values in secret manager
* connect rails app to production database and storage
* under [this link] (https://cloud.google.com/ruby/rails/run#windows) to setup the project on cloud. some of the files (dbpassword,.env file) are already created, thus edit accordingly
* edit the substituitions section under cloudbuild.yml file with your respective values created during the above setup

### Deployment to GCloud
* run `gcloud init` in Google Cloud  SDK and follow the steps accordingly
* run `gcloud auth login` to authenticate
* cd to /backend_cloudSQL_latest folder
* run `glocud builds submit` to deploy

# **RSpec Testing**

RSpec is a testing tool for Ruby, designed for unit testing. Unit testing involves testing individual units or components of software in isolation to ensure their correctness and reliability. RSpec provides a structured and expressive syntax for writing tests, that verify the behavior of our code's smaller units, such as methods and functions. We have created RSpec tests for our paynow and dispute model files to test that the methods called within them work as intended.<br>

To run these tests, follow the steps shown:

1. Enter your project directory
```shell
cd 1d-final-project-2023-sds-2023-team-08\backend_cloudSQL_latest
```

2. Install project dependencies using bundler
```shell
bundle install
```

3. Run the tests
```shell
bundle exec rspec
```

Allow the RSpec tests to run and return the results. <br>
